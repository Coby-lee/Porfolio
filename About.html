            <h2>The Human Behind the <span class="highlight">Code</span></h2>
            <p>
                I’m a digital creator based in Gauteng with a passion for building things that live at the intersection of <strong>function</strong> and <strong>feeling</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey started in the terminal, mastering the logic of HTML and CSS. But I quickly realized that clean code is only half the story—how a user <em>feels</em> when they click a button matters just as much as what happens when they do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether I'm collaborating on repositories like <strong>BusinessAgency</strong> or experimenting with motion graphics, my goal is always the same: to create digital experiences that are as intuitive as they are beautiful.
